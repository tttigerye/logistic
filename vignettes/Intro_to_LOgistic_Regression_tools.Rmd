This is introduction to my fantastic package.

I generally start with saying 'hello' in my package.
```{r}
hello(whateveryouwanttosay)
```

Secondly, I add some of my useful function about logistic regression.

we use the logistic function: f(z) = $\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$

```{r}
logistic_function(2)
```
