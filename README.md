# Logistic 

<!-- badges: start -->

## Overview

logistic is a tool package that aim to solve the issues happens during the analysis
of Logistic Regression, and generate basic analysis result:

- `describe_data()` Provides a thorough overview of a given dataframe.
- `standardize()` Standardizes specified columns in a dataframe.
- `upsampling()`  Balances binary class datasets via upsampling.
- `logistic_function()` Implements the logistic function, a key component in logistic regression.
- `fit_logistic_regression()` Implements the logistic regression algorithm.
- `fit_logistic_regression_to_data()` Fits a logistic regression model to a dataset.

These all combine naturally with `group_by()` which allows you to
perform any operation “by group”. You can learn more about them in
`vignette("dplyr")`. As well as these single-table verbs, dplyr also
provides a variety of two-table verbs, which you can learn about in
`vignette("two-table")`.

If you are new to dplyr, the best place to start is the [data
transformation chapter](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-transform) in R for
Data Science.
