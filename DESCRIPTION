Description: This package, LogisticRegToolkit, offers a streamlined approach to performing logistic regression analysis in R. It provides a set of user-friendly functions to fit logistic regression models, make predictions, and evaluate model performance. Unlike traditional implementations that rely on existing R functions, LogisticRegToolkit implements the underlying statistical methods from scratch, offering an educational insight into the mechanics of logistic regression. Functions include basic model fitting using gradient descent, prediction capabilities, and performance evaluation through accuracy metrics. This package is ideal for students and practitioners who seek a deeper understanding of logistic regression mechanics in R and those who prefer a simple and direct approach to logistic regression analysis.
